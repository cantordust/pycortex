# Overview

Python-based interface to PyTorch for evolving deep learning models.

For now, the library supports the following operations:

- Add / erase layers (convolutional or fully connected)
- Add / erase nodes (or kernels in convolutional layers)
- Grow or shrink kernels
- Crossover of deep NNs

All mutation and crossover operations should produce fully functional models which can be further trained with backprop.

All functionality will be backported to the C++ version of Cortex (with Python bindings for the die-hard Python fans).

# To install

Needs Python <= 3.6. To setup a dev version of the library

```
virtualenv -python=python3 venv  # if python3 is Python 3.6
pip install colorama torch numpy tensorboardX torchvision
```

# Check the tests run 

```
python unit_tests.py
```

# Run the MNIST test suite

```
cd experiments/MNIST
sh mnist.sh
```
