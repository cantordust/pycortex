Python-based interface to PyTorch for evolving deep learning models.

For now, the library supports the following operations:

- Add / erase layers (convolutional or fully connected)
- Add / erase nodes (or kernels in convolutional layers)
- Grow or shrink kernels
- Crossover of deep NNs

All mutation and crossover operations should produce fully functional models which can be further trained with backprop.

All functionality will be backported to the C++ version of Cortex (with Python bindings for the die-hard Python fans).
